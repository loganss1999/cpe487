# Lab 6: Video Game PONG

* Extend the FPGA code developed in Lab 3 (Bouncing Ball) to build a PONG game using a 800x600 Video Graphics Array (VGA) display and a 5kÎ© potentiometer with an analog-to-digital converter called Pmod ADC connected to the top pins of the Pmod port JA (See Section 10 of the [Reference Manual](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/nexys-a7_rm.pdf))

* 2019-11-15 pull request by Peter Ho with the 800x600@60Hz support for 100MHz clock

### 1. Create a new RTL project pong in Vivado Quick Start

* Create six new source files of file type VHDL called clk_wiz_0, clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz, vga_sync, bat_n_ball, adc_if, and pong

  * clk_wiz_0.vhd and clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz.vhd are the same files as in Lab 3
  
  * vga_sync.vhd, bat_n_ball.vhd, adc_if.vhd, and pong.vhd are new files for Lab 6

* Create a new constraint file of file type XDC called pong

* Choose Nexys A7-100T board for the project

* Click 'Finish'

* Click design sources and copy the VHDL code from clk_wiz_0, clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz, vga_sync.vhd, bat_n_ball.vhd, adc_if.vhd, pong.vhd

* Click constraints and copy the code from pong.xdc

### 2. Run synthesis

### 3. Run implementation and open implemented design

### 4. Generate bitstream, open hardware manager, and program device

* Click 'Generate Bitstream'

* Click 'Open Hardware Manager' and click 'Open Target' then 'Auto Connect'

* Click 'Program Device' then xc7a100t_0 to download pong.bit to the Nexys A7-100T board

* Push BTNC to start the bouncing ball and use the bat to keep the ball in play

### 5. Change ball speed

* The ball speed is currently 6 pixels per video frame

* Use the slide switches on the Nexys A7-100T board to program the ball speed in the range of 1-32 pixels per frame

* Avoid setting the speed to zero as the ball will then never reach the bat or wall

* See how fast to move the ball and still keep it in play

### 6. Change bat width

* Double the width of the bat to make the game really easy

* Modify the code so that the bat width decreases one pixel each time successfully hitting the ball and then resets to
starting width when missing the ball

* See how many times hitting the ball in a row as the bat slowly shrinks

* Count the number of successful hits after each serve and display the count in binary on the 7-segment displays of the Nexys A7-100T board
